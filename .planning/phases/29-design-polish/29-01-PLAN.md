# Plan 29-01: Visual Design Polish

## Objective

Iteratively refine the card design through visual assessment until cards look beautiful and professional. Use Chrome DevTools MCP to capture screenshots, evaluate the current design, make improvements, and verify the results.

## Prerequisites

- Phase 28 (Card Redesign) complete
- Application running at http://localhost:5657
- Chrome DevTools MCP available for screenshots

## Design Context

Current card design from Phase 28:
- **Card size:** 85x55mm (credit card size)
- **Front:** Genre background color, centered QR code (38mm), genre text below
- **Back:** Genre background, top bar (year | genre), album art (35mm), bottom bar (artist - title - album)
- **Bars:** 8mm height with semi-transparent black (#00000080)
- **Font sizes:** Genre text 10pt, top bar 9pt, bottom bar 7pt

Key design constants in code:
- `CardWidth = 85f` (mm)
- `CardHeight = 55f` (mm)
- `QrSize = 38f` (mm)
- `BarHeight = 8f` (mm)

## Execution Tasks

### Task 1: Initial Visual Assessment

**Action:** Start the application and capture screenshots of the current card design

1. Navigate to http://localhost:5657
2. Use playlist builder to add a sample song (e.g., "Bohemian Rhapsody" by Queen)
3. Take screenshot of the front card
4. Click to flip and take screenshot of the back card
5. Document visual assessment:
   - Spacing and margins
   - Font sizes and readability
   - Text bar proportions
   - QR code size relative to card
   - Album art sizing
   - Overall visual balance

**Verification:** Screenshots captured and assessment documented

---

### Task 2: Design Improvements

**Action:** Based on assessment, make targeted improvements to CardDesigner.cs and PdfExporter.cs

Areas to potentially adjust:
- QR code size and vertical positioning
- Genre text spacing from QR code
- Bar heights (top and bottom)
- Font sizes for better hierarchy
- Album art size relative to available space
- Spacing/padding within bars
- Visual rhythm and balance

**Files:**
- `Services/CardDesigner.cs`
- `Services/PdfExporter.cs`

Make changes in both files to keep them consistent.

**Verification:** `dotnet build` succeeds

---

### Task 3: Visual Verification and Iteration

**Action:** Rebuild, capture new screenshots, compare to initial, and iterate if needed

1. Rebuild with `dotnet build`
2. Refresh application (may need restart if running)
3. Capture new screenshots (front and back)
4. Compare to initial screenshots
5. Assess improvement - does it look more polished?
6. If further refinement needed, repeat Task 2 adjustments
7. Continue until cards look beautiful and professional

**Verification:** Screenshots show improved, polished design

---

### Task 4: Final Polish Pass

**Action:** Make any final micro-adjustments for print-readiness

1. Check text is readable at print size (85x55mm)
2. Ensure adequate contrast in all elements
3. Verify visual hierarchy is clear
4. Confirm alignment is pixel-perfect
5. Take final screenshots for documentation

**Verification:** Final design is print-ready and visually polished

---

## Completion Criteria

1. Initial screenshots captured and documented
2. Design improvements made based on assessment
3. Visual verification confirms improvement
4. Cards look beautiful and professional
5. Design is consistent between CardDesigner.cs and PdfExporter.cs
6. Final build succeeds: `dotnet build`

## Visual Quality Targets

- **Professional appearance:** Clean, balanced, well-proportioned
- **Print-ready:** Text readable at actual card size
- **Visual hierarchy:** Clear distinction between primary/secondary elements
- **Harmonious spacing:** Consistent margins and padding
- **Polished details:** No visual clutter or awkward gaps

## Notes

This is an iterative phase. The exact changes needed will be determined by visual assessment. Tasks 2-3 may repeat multiple times until the design meets quality targets.

Focus areas for polish (based on code review):
- Top spacer is 4mm - could adjust for better vertical centering
- QR size at 38mm leaves minimal margins on 85mm width
- Bar height 8mm might be adjusted for proportion
- Album art 35mm might benefit from slight adjustment
- Font sizes could use refinement for better hierarchy
