# Phase 8: Card Preview - Context

**Gathered:** 2025-12-21
**Status:** Ready for planning

<vision>
## How This Should Work

An interactive card builder where you flip through cards one at a time, carousel-style. Each card can be customized - pick colors, tweak the layout, and decide which songs make the final cut.

The experience is hands-on: you're crafting your deck, not just reviewing it. See a card, adjust its genre color, maybe bump up the font size, then swipe to the next one. It should feel like you're building something personal.

## What Must Be Nailed

- **Genre colors** - Each genre gets its own color scheme, making cards feel personalized
- **Visual accuracy** - What you see in preview must match the final PDF exactly
- **Card curation** - Being able to exclude or include specific songs in the final deck

All three are equally important for this phase to feel complete.

## What's Out of Scope

- PDF download/generation - that's Phase 9
- Re-matching songs with Spotify - work with current matches only
- Multiple card templates - one good card design is enough

</boundaries>

## Specific Ideas

- **Carousel view** - One card at a time, flip through the deck
- **Color system** - Start with preset palettes (Spotify vibes, neon, pastel, etc.), then fine-tune individual genres
- **Layout tweaking** - Adjust font sizes, spacing on cards
- **Include/exclude toggle** - Easy way to drop songs from the final deck

</specifics>

## Additional Context

This phase focuses on the builder experience before PDF generation. The user wants full control over customization (colors, layout, selection) but within a focused one-at-a-time interface rather than overwhelming grid views.
