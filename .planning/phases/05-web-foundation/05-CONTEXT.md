# Phase 5: Web Foundation - Context

**Gathered:** 2025-12-21
**Status:** Ready for research

<vision>
## How This Should Work

An integrated monorepo where the .NET backend and Svelte frontend live together in a single solution. The dev experience should be practical — optimized for tight iteration where Claude can easily self-check the web interface output.

The web app should feel beautiful, stylish, and impressive — but without sacrificing code simplicity. A simple mental model matters more than clever complexity.

The overall vibe is **fun and playful** — this is a music guessing game after all. It should bring joy when you use it. Think **bright and bold colors** — vibrant, energetic, Spotify-green kind of energy.

The UI should feel slick and modern with animations sprinkled throughout. That polished, premium web app feel where interactions have satisfying feedback.

## What Must Be Nailed

- **Clean project structure** - Well-organized folders, clear separation, easy to navigate as it grows
- **Working hot reload** - Changes show up instantly for both frontend AND backend
- **Solid API patterns** - Minimal API endpoints set up right from the start

All three matter equally — foundation done right.

## What's Out of Scope

No explicit exclusions set — open to whatever makes sense for a solid foundation.

Navigation structure (single page wizard vs separate routes) deferred to feature phases.

## Specific Ideas

- **Tailwind CSS** for styling — already planned, perfect for modern look with simple mental model
- **Animation library** — use a popular, lightweight library for Svelte to easily add animations without code complexity (Svelte's built-in transitions + supplemental library)
- **Animations everywhere** — sprinkle animations throughout for that slick, polished web app feel
- **Bright, bold palette** — vibrant colors, energetic feel matching the playful game vibe

</specifics>

<notes>
## Additional Context

User priority is **impressive visuals** but **simple code**. Don't over-engineer — use standard patterns and popular libraries that "just work."

The foundation should enable Claude to easily verify UI output during development, keeping iteration tight.
