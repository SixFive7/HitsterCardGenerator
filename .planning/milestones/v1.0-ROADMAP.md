# Milestone v1.0: MVP

**Status:** SHIPPED 2025-12-21
**Phases:** 1-4
**Total Plans:** 8

## Overview

Transform a CSV of songs into print-ready Hitster-style cards through a wizard-like console experience. Starting with project foundation and Spectre.Console UI, we add CSV import with validation, integrate Spotify for track lookups, and finish with QR code generation and PDF card export.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation

**Goal**: Running .NET 10 console app with Spectre.Console UI structure (FIGlet header, two-panel layout with step menu)
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 01-01: .NET 10 console app with Spectre.Console FIGlet header, two-panel wizard layout

### Phase 2: CSV Import

**Goal**: Import and validate semicolon-separated CSV with title, artist, year, genre headers; validate genres against 30+ popular genres + 5 French genres
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 02-01: Song record, 35-genre validator with typo suggestions, semicolon CSV parser
- [x] 02-02: CSV wizard integration with file selection and validation display

### Phase 3: Spotify Integration

**Goal**: Authenticate with Spotify API, search for tracks, apply smart selection logic, provide interactive fallback for ambiguous matches
**Depends on**: Phase 2
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 03-01: SpotifyAPI.Web integration with client credentials auth and wizard step
- [x] 03-02: Spotify track search with smart selection and manual fallback

### Phase 4: Card Generation

**Goal**: Generate QR codes linking to Spotify, design credit-card sized cards (85x55mm) with front (QR) and back (year/artist/title/genre), export PDF with cards in grid layout
**Depends on**: Phase 3
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 04-01: QR code generation with QRCoder and progress display
- [x] 04-02: Genre colors, color choice UI, and QuestPDF card designer
- [x] 04-03: PDF export with 2x5 grid and complete wizard flow

**Note**: Card layout adjusted to 2x5 grid (10 per A4) - 4x4 (16) doesn't physically fit with 85x55mm cards

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**

| Phase | Decision | Rationale |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| 0 | Semicolon CSV separator | Song titles may contain commas |
| 0 | 85x55mm card size | Standard Hitster card size |
| 0 | QuestPDF for PDF generation | Modern, fluent API, good for complex layouts |
| 0 | QRCoder for QR codes | Simple, well-maintained, cross-platform |
| 1 | .NET 10 target framework | Latest LTS for long-term support |
| 2 | Columns instead of Layout | Layout fills screen, breaks prompt display |
| 3 | SpotifyAPI.Web library | Standard .NET Spotify client, well-maintained |
| 3 | Client credentials flow | No user auth needed for track search |
| 3 | Smart selection priority | album > single > compilation, non-remastered preferred |
| 4 | Card grid layout | 2x5 (10 per A4) - original 4x4 (16) doesn't fit |

**Issues Resolved:**

- QuestPDF layout constraints with nested Row/Column (switched to Table)
- ExtendVertical() conflicts in fixed-height containers (used fixed spacers)

**Issues Deferred:**

- None

**Technical Debt Incurred:**

- None significant
