# Milestone v2.8: Simplification

## Status: SHIPPED 2025-12-26

## Goal

Simplify the application by unifying card rendering between preview and PDF, hardcoding the color scheme, redesigning cards for better aesthetics, and adding automated end-to-end testing.

## Phases

### Phase 26: Unified Rendering

**Goal**: Research and implement a unified card rendering approach so preview matches PDF exactly
**Status**: Complete

Implemented server-side card rendering using QuestPDF to generate PNG images for both preview and PDF export, ensuring pixel-perfect parity.

Plans:
- [x] 26-01: Research unified rendering approaches (4 tasks) - 2025-12-26
- [x] 26-02: Implement server-side card preview endpoints with caching (6 tasks) - 2025-12-26

### Phase 27: Simplify Color System

**Goal**: Remove color palette complexity - hardcode Spotify palette as the only option
**Status**: Complete

Removed palette selection UI and hardcoded the Spotify color palette as the only option.

Plans:
- [x] 27-01: Remove palette selection, hardcode Spotify colors (5 tasks) - 2025-12-26

### Phase 28: Card Redesign

**Goal**: Redesign cards for better visual appearance
**Status**: Complete

Implemented new card design with:
- Front: Centered QR code on genre-colored background
- Back: Album art with metadata overlay (year/genre top, artist/title bottom)

Plans:
- [x] 28-01: Implement new card design with centered QR (4 tasks) - 2025-12-26
- [x] 28-02: Integrate album data for back design (5 tasks) - 2025-12-26

### Phase 29: Design Polish

**Goal**: Visual iteration on card appearance until polished
**Status**: Complete

Refined card proportions, text sizing, and spacing for improved readability and aesthetics.

Plans:
- [x] 29-01: Polish card design with improved proportions (3 tasks) - 2025-12-26

### Phase 30: Automated E2E Testing

**Goal**: Full end-to-end test coverage using Chrome DevTools MCP
**Status**: Complete

Verified full application flow using Chrome DevTools MCP tools:
- CSV upload and matching
- Card preview and flip functionality
- PDF export verification

Plans:
- [x] 30-01: Automated E2E testing with Chrome DevTools MCP (5 tasks) - 2025-12-26

## Summary

- **Total phases**: 5
- **Total plans**: 7
- **Phase range**: 26-30
