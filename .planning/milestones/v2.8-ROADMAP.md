# Milestone v2.8: Simplification

## Status: In Progress

## Goal

Simplify the application by unifying card rendering between preview and PDF, hardcoding the color scheme, redesigning cards for better aesthetics, and adding automated end-to-end testing.

## Phases

### Phase 26: Unified Rendering

**Goal**: Research and implement a unified card rendering approach so preview matches PDF exactly
**Status**: Pending

Research approaches:
- Server-side PNG/SVG rendering
- Shared canvas/SVG code
- QuestPDF-driven preview generation
- Other options

Present options to user with pros/cons, then implement chosen solution.

Plans: TBD

**Status**: Pending

Tasks:
- Use Chrome DevTools screenshots to check design

Plans: TBD

### Phase 30: Automated E2E Testing

**Goal**: Full end-to-end test coverage using Chrome DevTools MCP
**Status**: Pending

Test flow:
- CSV upload -> match -> preview -> flip -> PDF export
- Use Chrome DevTools MCP for browser automation
- Verify preview cards match exported PDF

Plans: TBD

## Summary
