**Details:**
- Search API endpoint at GET /api/search?q={query} returning up to 20 Spotify tracks
- SpotifySearch.svelte component with 300ms debounced input
- Results display with 64x64 album artwork thumbnails matching app aesthetic

### Phase 18: Playlist Builder

### Phase 19: Flow Integration

**Goal**: Landing page dual-path choice, skip matching for built playlists
