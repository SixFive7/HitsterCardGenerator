# Milestone v2.5: Self-Hosting

**Status:** SHIPPED 2025-12-25
**Phases:** 20-21
**Total Plans:** 2

## Overview

Remove CI/CD pipeline and registry dependency - users build locally from any git source. This milestone simplifies deployment by eliminating the need for container registry access, enabling zero-friction self-hosting with docker-compose build-from-URL.

## Phases

### Phase 20: Remove CI/CD

**Goal**: Delete release.yml workflow and create .env.example for clearer setup
**Depends on**: Previous milestone complete
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 20-01: Delete CI/CD workflow + create .env.example (2 tasks)

**Details:**
- Deleted .github/workflows/release.yml CI/CD pipeline
- Removed entire .github/ directory structure
- Created .env.example with documented required (Spotify) and optional (PUID/PGID/TZ) environment variables
- Completed: 2025-12-25 (1 min)

### Phase 21: Local Build Docs

**Goal**: Update README for clone + docker compose build workflow
**Depends on**: Phase 20
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 21-01: README with build-from-URL docker-compose examples (2 tasks)

**Details:**
- Removed CI/CD badges and ghcr.io image references from README
- Added Portainer-friendly build-from-URL docker-compose in Quick Start
- Added Traefik reverse proxy example with build-from-URL approach
- Updated multi-architecture note to reflect local build workflow
- Completed: 2025-12-25 (1 min)
